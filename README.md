EJ Website
EJ Website is an e-commerce platform dedicated to selling customized flowers and cakes, available exclusively in Jordan and the United Arab Emirates.
The project was created as part of my second-year studies at HTU University. It showcases my early work in front-end and back-end web development using:

*  HTML
*  CSS
* JavaScript
* PHP
The site allows customers to browse, personalize, and order floral arrangements and cakes designed for special occasions.
